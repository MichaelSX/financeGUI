## FinanceAppGUI
---
`In progress`.

GUI for tracking statements and visual evaluation.

For productive usage create a SQLite3 database similar to dummy_db.db, copy the config file, rename it to config.txt and adapt the path to the database-file. This config-file will not be tracked by git.

#### Next Steps:
- Selection of database-file inside of GUI
- Editing entries in FinanceAppGUI
- regular transactions for planning (e.g. salary)

#### Done:
- Selection of time frame
- config-File for different databases
- Diagrams
